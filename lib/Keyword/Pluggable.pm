=head1 NAME

Keyword::Pluggable - define new keywords in pure Perl

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 package Some::Module;
 
 use Keyword::Pluggable;
 
 sub import {
     # create keyword 'provided', expand it to 'if' at parse time
     Keyword::Pluggable::define 
	 keyword => 'provided', 
	 package => scalar(caller),
	 code    => 'if',
     ;
 }
 
 sub unimport {
    # disable keyword again
    Keyword::Pluggable::undefine keyword => 'provided', package => scalar(caller);
 }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Warning: This module is still new and experimental. The API may change in
future versions. The code may be buggy. Also, this module is a fork from
C<Keyword::Simple>, that somehow got stalled. If its author accepts pull
requests, then it will probably be best to use it instead.

This module lets you implement new keywords in pure Perl. To do this, you need
to write a module and call
L<C<Keyword::Pluggable::define>|/Keyword::Pluggable::define> in your C<import>
method. Any keywords defined this way will be available in the scope
that's currently being compiled. The scope can be lexical, packaged, and global.

=head2 Functions

=over

=item C<Keyword::Pluggable::define %options>

=over

=item keyword

The keyword is injected in the scope currently being compiled

=item code (string or coderef)

For every occurrence of the keyword, your coderef will be called and its result
will be injected into perl's parse buffer, so perl will continue parsing as if
its contents had been the real source code in the first place. 

=item expression

Boolean flag; if true then the perl parser will treat new code as expression,
otherwise as a statement

=item global

Boolean flag; if set, then the scope is global, otherwise it is lexical or packaged

=item package

If set, the scope will be limited to that package, otherwise it will be lexical

=back

=item C<Keyword::Pluggable::undefine %options>

Allows options: C<keyword>, C<global>, C<package> (see above).

Disables the keyword in the given scope. You can call this from your
C<unimport> method to make the C<no Foo;> syntax work.

=head1 BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

This module depends on the L<pluggable keyword|perlapi.html/PL_keyword_plugin>
API introduced in perl 5.12. C<parse_> functions were introduced in 5.14.
Older versions of perl are not supported.

Every new keyword is actually a complete statement or an expression by itself. The parsing magic
only happens afterwards. This means that e.g. the code in the L</SYNOPSIS>
actually does this:

  provided ($foo > 2) {
	...
  }

  # expands to

  ; if
  ($foo > 2) {
	...
  }

The C<;> represents a no-op statement, the C<if> was injected by the Perl code,
and the rest of the file is unchanged.

This also means your new keywords can only occur at the beginning of a
statement, not embedded in an expression.

Keywords in the replacement part of a C<s//.../e> substitution aren't handled
correctly and break parsing.

There are barely any tests.
